TODOS:
-Pull subscriptions from firebase on login, store them into state using redux with a new reducer (subscriptions, subscriptionsReducer)
    Eventually pull subscriptions from Stripe, store them into state using redux
    
-Add option for primitive subscribe/unsubscribe to a page
-Display option to upload a new post if you're on your own page.
-Setup firebase storage for post images, etc.

Everyday at midnight can run subscription updater on firebase cloud functions
